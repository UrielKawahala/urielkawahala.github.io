	<h2 id=0>Game Design Projects</h2>
	<p>Unfortunately I don't exactly have a massive amount of published projects, and the ones that are available are mostly oldies I made for game jams. These are also in portuguese only since they were both produced for Brazilian game jams. Either way, if for some reason you're interested in them...</p>

	<p>From early 2020, Orion is the first game I ever released, and boy can you tell... It's also one of my first serious attempts at using GameMaker Studio and it's text-based programming language, GML, and you can also tell that. It runs about as well as an RC toy car that's low on batteries and missing it's hind wheels, it's themes clash against the game jam's, given the jam's theme was stay at home, and your main objective in the game is to <i>exit</i> the house, and to say it's gameplay is boring would be a <i>MAJOR</i> understatement, given it's basically a walking simulator where you do tasks to  <i>s l o w l y</i>  uncover a letter with a message from a character who's relevance is not once made clear. But you know what? I love it! Had it not been for this game, I most likely wouldn't have gone all into game development. Taking part on that game jam and publishing my first game was an incredibly valuable experience that I'll cherish forever.

	<p>Here's something a bit nicer: DeltaTime! From mid 2020, You can tell I developed a bit more game design experience going into this one. DeltaTime is a 1-bit platformer where you can travel between two slightly different versions of a continuous level, past and present. It was also made for a game jam, with this one's themes being time travel. In hindsight it's a bit generic and certain parts of it could have been designed a bit differently (for example, it likely would have benefited from having separete levels instead of one long hallway) but eh, it's not exactly terrible. If you're looking for a short little, almost flash-type platformer game, maybe give it a try!

	<div class="center">Status: Ongoing!</div><br>
	<p>This one's funny. I was in a VC with a few friends when my pal Trickmint showed me an <a href="https://trickmint.surge.sh/baguette/">HTML5 remake</a> he had hosted on his website of a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/346825994/">Scratch project</a> called "Baguette clicker". After
	 he showed me this gem of a game I thought to myself: "Hmm, I can probably do better than him" and thus, Ciabatta clicker was born so in a sense it's a parody of a parody of a parody! I plan to release frequent updates to this game,
	so if you're interested at all make sure to check its page every now and then.</p>

	<p>All things considered, I'm a bit prouder of my localization work than my GameDev stuff, it's really something I should do more, haha</p>

	<p>Nitorinc: Touhou Microgames is a collaborative project aiming to create a WarioWare inspired fast-paced microgame collection using characters and set pieces from the Touhou Project bullet hell sh'mup series. I localized a considerable amount of the game into Brazilian Portuguese!</p>
